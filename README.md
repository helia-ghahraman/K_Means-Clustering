# K_Means-Clustering
Simple K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset.
# A brief explanation
In this project, we aimed to cluster the data in a way that matches the labels. According to that, we implement a k-means algorithm with optional k values and evaluate the accuracy of our method with different k’s. We show the effect of different k’s on accuracy.
After that we tried to found some good measures which using them we could evaluate our clustering using only the training data in a way that works the best on the test data too.
