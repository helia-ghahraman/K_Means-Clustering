# K_Means-Clustering
Simple K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset.
Here we have got a dataset in which each data has a label revealing what cluster they belong. In this project, we aimed to cluster the data in a way that matches the labels.
According to that, we implement a k-means algorithm with optional k and evaluate the accuracy of our method with different k’s.
We show the influence of different k’s and moreover how to do clustering using only the training data in a way that works the best on the test data too which eventually leads to  demonstration of how to evaluate our clustering method.
